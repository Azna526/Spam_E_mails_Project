# Spam Email Classification Project

This project focuses on detecting spam emails using Machine Learning techniques.  
It involves preprocessing email text, extracting features, and applying classifiers to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
